I'm a Master student in the School of Software, Tsinghua University, advised by Prof Yu Jiang. I received my BS degree from School of Computer Science, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2021.6.

My research is focused on automated vulnerability detection and program analysis of network protocol implementations via techniques like fuzzing, where I investigate practical topics such as efficiency, scalability, and reliability of automated techniques via theoretical and empirical analysis.
